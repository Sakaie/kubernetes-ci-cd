# Linux.com Kubernetes CI/CD Blog Series by Kenzan

The kubernetes-ci-cd project is [Kenzan's](https://kenzan.com/) crossword puzzle application that runs as several containers in Kubernetes (we call it the Kr8sswordz Puzzle). It showcases Kubernetes features like spinning up multiple pods and running a load test at scale. It also features Jenkins running on its own a container and a JenkinsFile script to demonstrate how Kubernetes can be integrated into a full CI/CD pipeline.
